# Visualization of the phone-dependent distributions of the context unit vectors learnt by the UniNet and Tacotron2

A re-implementation of Colin Eberhardt's [tSNE Plot](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/d3fc-webgl-hathi-explorer) of Hathi Trust library books clustered using [T-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding).

This implementation uses D3FC's WebGL Series.
