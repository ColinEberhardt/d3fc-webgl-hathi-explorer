# hathi-explorer

A re-implementation of Ben Schmidt's [Deep Scatter Plot](http://creatingdata.us/techne/deep_scatterplots/) of Hathi Trust library books clustered using [T-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding).

This implementation uses D3FC's WebGL Series.
